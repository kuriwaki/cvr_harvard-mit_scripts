# CVR_Harvard-MIT

##### Project leads: Shiro Kuriwaki and Mason Reece

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of CVR_Harvard-MIT is to coordinate the "Harvard" and "MIT" team's CVR data.

The github repo is kept for _issue tracking purposes_ and _maintaining data construction scripts_ only.

- As of 2024-04-24, there should be no data or critical scripts stored in this repo.  Some scripts in `R` are useful as they describe how certian cleaned datasets were made. 

- We may share a Dropbox to share cleaned data in the future.

- See the shared Dropbox `CVR_parquet` for subsets of cleaned in parquet format.
