# CVR_Harvard-MIT

##### Project leads: Shiro Kuriwaki and Mason Reece

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of CVR_Harvard-MIT is to coordinate the “Harvard” and “MIT”
team’s CVR data.

The github repo is kept for *issue tracking purposes* and *maintaining
data construction scripts* only.

- As of 2024-04-24, there should be no data or critical scripts stored
  in this repo. Some scripts in `R` are useful as they describe how
  certian cleaned datasets were made.

- We may share a Dropbox to share cleaned data in the future.

- See the Dropbox `CVR_parquet` for subsets of cleaned data.
