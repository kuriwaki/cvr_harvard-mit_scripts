The goal of CVR_Harvard-MIT is to coordinate the “Harvard” and “MIT”
team’s CVR data.

As of 2024-04-24, previous files for exploratory analysis were cleared.
The github repo is kept for issue tracking purposes only.

- As of 2024-04-24, there should be no data or critical scripts stored
  in this repo. Some scripts in `R/prepare` are useful as they describe
  how certian cleaned datasets were made.

- We may share a Dropbox to share cleaned data in the future.

- See `CVR_parquet` for subsets of cleaned data.
